MFEprimer 1.6 [Nov-4-2009]

1. Fix a parsing bug for LightBio.LightBlastParser when Blast report file 
   contains "Expect(2)" or "Expect(3)".

MFEprimer 1.5 [Jun-22-2009]

1. Add --ppc_cutoff parameter, it act as -s.
2. Add --seq and --fasta parameters, both of them let user output the
    amplicons sequence in Fasta format.
3. Changing the temporary Blast file name from a constant name to a
    name with 20 letters generatered randomly. This changes would fix
    the problem happened when two or more MFEprimer running at the same
    time in the same directory.

1. A serious bug has been fixed. Thanks Prof. Zhang very much. 
    I forget this important code:
        rtail = LS.seq(rtail).rev_com # Thanks Prof. Zhang for finding this bug

    of MFEprimer is also available. 
2. In this version, MFEprimer has the 
    ability to evaluate the specificity of PCR primers as the paper described.
