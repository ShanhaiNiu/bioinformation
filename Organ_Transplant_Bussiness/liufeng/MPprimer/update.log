MPprimer-1.5 [2016-3-15]

1. Bug fixed: MPprimer_dimer_check.pl

MPprimer-1.4 [2010-6-10]

1. In this version of MPprimer, there will be a matrix created 
   by MPprimer every time when designing primers.  This matrix contains 
   values between 0 and 1 for indicating the compatibility of each two 
   templates.  If two templates has an matrix value of "0" or closer 
   to "0", that means they are compatible. Otherwise, if the matrix 
   value is "1" or closer to "1", that means they can not be grouped 
   into one group. By inspecting this matrix, we can find out the 
   template(s) which can not be grouped into one group with other templates. 
   According to this matrix, we can split the templates into two or 
   more groups manually. Although this is not an automatics way and 
   requires much patience, it's really a solution for the problem. 
   In my laboratory, this matrix is very helpful and efficient when 
   I designing multiplex PCR primers.

MPprimer-1.3 [2010-1-26]

1. Export primer in fasta format with the name of "output + '.fa'".
2. Updating PSC searching algorithm - graph-expanding algorithm.
   The new algorithm are much faster then the old one but sacrifice
   some accuracy.

MPprimer-1.2 [2009-11-6]

1. Replace the option "-r" with "-W" and "-e".

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

MPprimer-1.1 [2009-11-4]

1. Add the 5' and 3' mark for primers.
2. Add template sequence ID in MPprimer ouput file.
3. Fix a bug of LightBio.LightBlastParser which
   can not parse correctly when Blast report file
   contains "Expect(2)" or "Expect(3", etc.
4. Fix a very import bug. MPprimer would collapse when
   Primer3 found fewer than 5 primers for a template.
